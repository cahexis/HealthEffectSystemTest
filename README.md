READ ME PLEASEE

Hi! This was a one day challenge to try to create something in less than 24/7, I like to do these sometimes. <br/>
For this one, it isn't very functional as I rushed trying to get some parts to work (and I had homework), so its mostly just scraps. (As of Dec 4 2025, I reworked some of the code and cleaned it up a bit!) <br/>

The files in this repository will show the scripts used for this one, if you would like to see the models and whatnot, check out the rbxl file!!  <br/>
(name).client.lua = local script  <br/>
(name).server.lua = server script <br/>
(name).lua = module script <br/>
  <br/>
If you want to use this project for anything, just give credit and link back to here.
